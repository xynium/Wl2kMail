PNMail

For making mail ready to be send by PNWl2k, it is a mono executable so it may be run on window (not tested) but should run on any linux (i use ubuntu16).

In the tarball file there is the code.

From the code the PNMail file system should be modified to fit ones installation.
by default it is ~/PNMail/OutBox  ~/PNMail/InBox
